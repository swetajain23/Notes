for install Linux:
download two softwares:
1. ubuntu-12.10 => www.ubuntu.com
2. Universal USB Installer-1.9.1.7 =>www.pendrivelinux.com

How to create User in linux:
1.sudo adduser <username>cd ..
cmd => sudo adduser rduser
       sudo su rduser
2.set password for new user:
   cntrl+R , ssh set ip and user name
   sudo su rduser
   enter new password
   cntrl+R , ssh set ip and user name:
=> ssh rduser@172.25.41.20

changing from user to superuser:
>>sudo su -
changing from superuser to user:
>>sudo su - user 

for exit:
use cntrl + D

how to stop firewall:
suso su
pwd
service firewalld status
service firewalld stop

How to delete user in linux:
cmd => sudo userdel rduser

ls => list of current directories and files in the present working directory
ls -R => list of current directories with subdirectories as well
ls -a => list hidden files as well
ls -la => lists files and directories with detailed information


Getting detailed file information: =>
drwxr-xr-x => file types and accessermissions
22 => memory block
guru99 => owner of file
guru99 => user group
4096 => size(bytes)
2013-01-04 23:57 => date & time
.bash_history => file & directory name


Viewing Hidden Files: =>
ls -a => shows all hidden files start with '.' period symbol

For see the path: =>
pwd


Creating & Viewing Files: =>
The cat Command => use to display , copy , combine and create text files
cat > file1 => command for create file (cntrl c)
touch file4 => command for create file
cat file1 => display the file
cat > file2
cat file1 file2 > newfile => combine both files and create newfile
cat newfile => display


Deleting Files: =>
rm<filename>
cmd => rm Test => remove Test file
ls


Moving Files: =>
mv<filename><newfilelocation>
cmd => mv test /home/guru99/Files => Permission denied

move file from local system to remote location:
syntax: scp <file_path> <user>@<remote_host>:<remote_dir>
=>> cd D:/sampleData
=>> scp employees.csv rduser@impetus-b0063:~

move firle from remote location to local system:
syntax: scp <user>@<remote_host>:<remote_file_path> <local_dir>

move command needs super user permission so we will use sudo command.
sudo mv test /home/guru99/Files => ask for password for authentication
sudo command allows regular users to run programs as superuser or root
sudo maintain log of each command run.

Renaming Files: =>
mv<filename><newfilename>
cmd => mv test test1 => rename test file with test1


Creating Directories: =>
mkdir<directoryname>
 cmd => mkdir songs

How to create parent directories: =>
mkdir -p foo/bar/baz

creating directory at a new location: =>
mkdir</path/new_directory_name>

cmd => mkdir /tmp/music

Creating multiple directories at a time: =>
mkdir<dir1><dir2><dir3>

cmd => mkdir direc direc1 direc2
ls => will show list


Removing Directories: =>
rmdir<directoryname>
cmd => rmdir direc
>> rm -r direc

Renaming Directory: =>
mv directoryname newdirectoryname
cmd => mv direc2 direc4

changing column seperator:
>>tr '|' ',' <filename


The 'Man' Command: =>
Man stands for manual
The reference book for Linux
It is similar to HELP file
man<command>
cmd => man ls => will give list directory contents

The History Command: =>
shows commands have used in the past
cmd => history

The Clear Command: =>
command cleans the terminal
cmd => clear

Linux Security: =>
three owners => user,group,other
ls -l => give list
r = read permission
w = write permission
x = execute permission
- = no permission

-rw-rw-r--
first hiphen '-' shows it is a file
rw- shows first user can read and write the file only
rw- shows second owner 'group' can read and write the file
r-- shows third owner 'other' can read the file only

drwxr-xr-x
d shows directory
rwx
r-x
r-x


Changing file/directory permissions: =>
chmod permissions filename
=> stands for 'change mode'
=>using the command, we can set permissions(read,write,execute) on a file/directory for the owner, group anf the world.
chmod can be used in 2 ways: =>
1. Absolute(Numeric) mode:
ex: cmd => chmod 764 test => read,write & execute for the user
                          => read & write for group
                          => read for All


2. Symbolic mode
=> change permissions for a specific owner
+ => add a permission to a file or directory
- => removes the permission
= => sets the permission and overrides the permissions set earlier

User denotations:
u => user/owner
g => group
o => other
a => all

ex: cmd => chmod o=rwx test =>change the permission for other
    cmd => chmod g+x test => add execute permission for group
    cmd => chmpd u-r test  => remove read permission for user


Changing Ownership and Group:
chown user<filename>
chown user:group<filename>
ex: cmd => sudo chown root commands (previously owner was guru99 but after this command owner is root for file commands)

ex: cmd => sudo chown gurur99:guru99 commands(change both owner and group owner) 

ex: cmd => sudo chgrp root commands (change the group user owner to root)

Tips on Usergroups:
1. /etc/group => it contains all groups defined in the system

file system -> etc directory -> search for group files

2. command 'groups' => to find all the groups you are the member of

3. Command 'newgrp' => as a member of new group
cmd => newgrp cdrom
       cat > test
       ls -dl test
4. 2 Groups cannot own the same file.


Print, E-mail & Install Software on Linux: =>
1. pr Command
2. pr -x tools => divide the data into x columns
3.pr -h HomeTools tools => HomeTools will be header of tools file
4. pr -n => denotes all lines with numbers
5. lp filename or lpr filename => for printing a filename
6. lp -nN filename or lpr n filename => prinnting 'N' copies of file
7. lp -dPrintername filename or lpr -PPrintername filename


Installing Software: =>
1.sudo apt-get install softwarename
ex: sudo apt-get install vlc

sending email:
first install mailx: =>
1.sudo apt-get install mailx
2. y
3. type of mail configuration
installed

4.

Environment Variables:

echo $VARIABLE =>To display value of a variable

env            =>Displays all environment variables

VARIABLE_NAME= variable_value 
               =>Create a new variable

unset          =>Remove a variable

export Variable=value 
               =>To set value of an environment variable
